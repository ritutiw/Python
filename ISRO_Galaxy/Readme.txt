Using a futuristic telescope, ISRO gathered data of nebulas that are several lights years away from earth. With some analysis this data is mapped into two dimensional data (file galaxy.xlsx provided with this document). ISRO's scientific probe is converging to a point that shows the formation of five possible star coagulations from these nebulas. As a data scientist you are expected to help ISRO to analyze their data further. Answer the following questions. 

Find out the values of DBSCAN parameters (mathematically supported) that prove the hypotheses of ISRO scientists.
